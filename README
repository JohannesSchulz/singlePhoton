# Hi everyone!
# Currently I'm working on the Single Photon SUSY analysis, so most of the
# code will be related to this analysis.

# The nTuplizer for SUSY Photon analysis will be used. See
# https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SWGuideSusyNtuplesRA3
# for more infos. Once you have the nTuples, make TTrees out of them
# using my TreeWriter. To run the TreeWriter, you have at least check out
# /UserCode/LPCPJM/SusyAnalysis/SusyNtuplizer to build the dictionary.
make -C LPCPJM/SusyAnalysis/SusyNtuplizer/macro
cp LPCPJM/SusyAnalysis/SusyNtuplizer/macro/libSusyEvent.so TreeWriter
cd TreeWriter
# change input filename in ana.C to be one nTuple
root -b -q -l ana.C
# an output tree should have been produced
cd ../plotTree
./simplePlot -f ../TreeWriter/myoutputTree.root -d met -c "photon.eta < 1 && nVertex > 3" # or something likewise
