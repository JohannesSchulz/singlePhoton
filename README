# Hi everyone!
# Currently I'm working on the Single Photon SUSY analysis, so most of the
# code will be related to this analysis.

# The nTuplizer for SUSY Photon analysis will be used. See
# https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SWGuideSusyNtuplesRA3
# for more infos. Once you have the nTuples, make TTrees out of them
# using my TreeWriter
