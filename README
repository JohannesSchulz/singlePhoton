# Hi everyone!
# Currently I'm working on the Single Photon SUSY analysis, so most of the
# code will be related to this analysis.

# The nTuplizer for SUSY Photon analysis will be used. See
# https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SWGuideSusyNtuplesRA3
# for more infos. Once you have the nTuples, make TTrees out of them
# using my TreeWriter.

# A list of variables saved:
# photonCollection: eta, pt, phi, all variables used for photon and fakeobject identification
# jetCollection, electrons, muons, ht, nvertex, met, etc
# No jet cleaning is applied in this step, but the photon.pt is pt from the matched jet

cd TreeWriter
# change input and outputfilenames in execute.cc
make
(./execute)
# an output tree should have been produced
cd ../plotTree
./simplePlot -h
./simplePlot -f ../TreeWriter/myoutputTree.root -d met -c "photon.eta < 1 && nVertex > 3" # or something likewise
